# Travel Optimizer

This project is a sample Node.js and React application that searches for flights from multiple sources and displays the cheapest options. It provides a simple front-end inspired by the visual identity of [UDS](https://uds.com.br/).

## Running

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The server runs on port 3000 and serves the React front-end from the `public` directory.
